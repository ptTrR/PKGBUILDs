Subject: [PATCH] use -mcpu= avoiding -march and -mtune for armv7h

From what I understand, when building on ARM, it's best to  avoid the -march=
flag and rather use -mcpu= flag due to differences in meaning on ARM vs x86[1].
Additionally, this patch avoids thousands of warns like the following when
building for armv7h:
 cc1: warning: switch '-mcpu=cortex-a72' conflicts with '-march=armv8-a'

This is due to the way ffmpeg's configure script defines -march=armv8-a when it
encounters any cortex-a* passed to it.

for reference and to experiment:
untar ffmpeg, run ./configure, then inspect the output of ffbuild/config.mak and adjust:
kodi-build/build/ffmpeg/src/ffmpeg-build/ffmpeg-prefix/src/ffmpeg-build/ffbuild/config.mak
